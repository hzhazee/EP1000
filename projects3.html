                Firstly, I started off with a sketch to get an idea as to what my measurements would be. I was not too sure what the size of the music mechanism was so I thought it would be a good idea to come up with a draft box first and get it cut before starting on the final one. As a first-time user, it was also a good opportunity to be working hands-on with the laser cutter at least once to get a hang of how it and the software controllers work.

                <p>
                After confirming what I wanted the sizes to be, it was time to bring my ideas from paper to Fusion 360. With reference to my sketches, I began by doing the sketch for the front face first. As I was reading through the assignment slides, I made sure to take note of the most important parts to ensure that I was doing the steps correctly. One of them was to split each part of the box into different components so that not only would it be less confusing, but it would be easier to save each of them later. With the front face sketch done, I then extruded it to 3 mm to match the material that I will be using and made sure that I had an odd number of tabs.
                </p>
                <p>
                Next, it was time to sketch the left side of the box. I followed the same steps as before, also ensuring that I started sketching on the edge of the front tab so that they would fit in nicely. I finished the sketch with the desired measurements and proceeded to get it extruded.
                </p>
                With the front and side faces done, I duplicated them as the back and right pieces are the same respectively. This was done by creating midplanes and using the "Mirror" tool. Now that I have all 4 sides, I then sketched out the base using a regular two-point rectangle that fit all the edges of the box. I did not have to worry about sketching out tabs as I could simply use the "Combine" tool. It was really convenient to use this tool as it could automatically create the cuts with reference to the previously extruded front and side faces. After checking each of the sides, I then saved each of them as DXF files so that they would be ready to be sent to the laser cutter.
                <p>
                Aside from the box itself, I also wanted to test out how a design would appear on the lid. In Illustrator, I created a simple pixelated heart which had its outline engraved and a small inner part that would be cut out. With all my parts ready, I then sent them to the laser cutter. I assembled the box and compared it to the newly-provided music mechanism to see if it would fit. It looked satisfactory so I decided to stick to its measurements for the final box.

                Before starting on the actual box, I searched up some references for inspiration. Most of the music boxes I saw were relatively simple; they mainly had a lid which could be flipped up, and a hole on the right side. As for the design, I wanted to keep it minamalistic as the melody that came out of the given music mechanism was very soft and sweet. I also planned to cut out the circular part and engrave the outline of the waves.

                As I had already made a draft box, I used the same measurements to make the final one. 
                At this point it was mainly to ideate the lid and how it would fit onto the box. Some of the things that was done was to reduce the height of the front face by 3 mm (the thickness of the material) and adding holed tabs on the top of the side faces. These holes would then house the fingers located at the sides of the lid so that it would be movable. Last but not least, I added a hole on the right side so that the crank of the music mechanism could come out of it.

                After laser cutting the pieces, I was a little shocked to see that the measurements did not match what I had in mind. I had planned for the sizes to be the same as my draft box but they turned out to be much bigger. The length of the box was originally supposed to be about 7 to 8 cm but the result ended up being more than twice the size! Thank goodness the ratios were still the same so I did not have to worry too much. To be honest, I am not too sure what caused this because I do not recall changing any settings and simply brought over the layout from CorelDraw straight into the laser cutting software. Alas, this is just a minor issue and something that I ended up not really minding as it is much better for the box to be bigger rather than too small that the music mechanism would not be able to fit. In addition, I could probably use it as a storage box too due to its size.
                </p>
                <p>
                This could just be me being a very nitpicky design student but the design that I wanted engraved on the lid is not centralised! This I blame myself. I should have checked the layout several times before sending it to cut. I was maybe a little too hasty, which resulted in me being a little bothered the moment I saw the laser engraving the wooden lid. From this experience, I definitely learnt to make sure that I check every single thing in the software, from the size down to the layout before sending my design to the laser cutter.
                </p>
                <p>
                After assembling the pieces, to be honest I was a little disappointed that some of the tabs were jutting out. This was obviously due to the fact that the measurements ended up being larger than expected. However, I am just glad that they all fit well with some glue and that the box is nice ansd stable. I had a scrap piece of plywood from my previous laser cutting session so I decided to use it as a "background" for my designed lid. I painted some parts for a more personalised touch (although it could have been more precise), glued in the music mechanism and finally I was done.
