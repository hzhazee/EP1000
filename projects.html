                Coming from MAD school, I am already quite familiar with Adobe Photoshop but it is always good to learn alternative softwares which are free such as GIMP. It was easy to use and its tools are surprisingly similar to PhotoShop. The processes of swapping backgrounds and inserting a subject was relatively straightforward to me. In future where I am no longer an SP student, I could see myself using this software since no payment is required.

                With Inkscape, the controls are quite different than Adobe Illustrator. To resize an image but maintain the ratio of its height and width, I had to hold on to the Ctrl key instead of the Shift key like in Illustrator. Zooming in and out was usually done using the Ctrl with + and - keys but in Inkscape, this could be done using the scroll located at the bottom right. Aside from the shortcuts, the tools were self-explanatory and within a few minutes, I was able to trace out an image and create a simple logo. It is still hard for me to believe this app is free! Depending on one's creativity, it has such a wide variety of options available for creating vector art.

                In my experience from my course, I am familiar with many 3D softwares such as Cinema4D, Maya and Blender but obviously, they are not really made specfically for 3D printing. Using Fusion 360 felt really new to me and was unlike the other softwares I use on a regular basis. It took a while to get used to it but with the help of the tutorials provided, I managed to learn some basic tools and complete the exercises with ease. Its tools are useful and simple to navigate. My favourite part of Fusion 360 was the construction lines that act as a guide which definitely helps for greater accuracy in measurements.
