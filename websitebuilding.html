                After watching Jake Wright's video on building a basic website, it was time to create my own. I knew I wanted my website to look minimalistic and clean-looking, so I kept to a colour palette I found on Pinterest and applied it accordingly in CSS with reference to his video. I learnt how CSS was very useful in categorising design styles without having to put them into a HTML code itself. Hence, I applied this technique into my website and it definitely made things easier so that everything would be consistent.

                Aside from using Jake Wright's video, I also used the website w3schools.com which had a lot of useful tutorials on how I could further personalise my website. With those tutorials, I was able to create a dropdown navigation bar at the top. The tutorials available in w3schools.com were very easy to follow and the examples provided made it much easier for me to understand how I could apply a certain function into my website.
