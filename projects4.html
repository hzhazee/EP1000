                When I first looked at the schematic, to be honest I was very confused. It has been quite some time since I did the electricity component in Physics in secondary school. It took me a while to understand the purpose of each component in a circuit. I had to do some extra reading to fully refresh my memory about the concepts that apply to electrical currents. Most of the electronic symbols were very new to me as back in school, I remember only learning the basics. Once I had a good understanding of them, I then managed to convert the schematic into Tinkercad, which was something I was also very new to. Fortunately, Tinkercad had plenty of tutorials which helped to guide me along.

                Although this assignment was guided, I managed to learn quite a bit how LEDs can be connected in a practical way. It was good to read the article attached in the presentation as it helped me to understand better how it all works. At first, it was quite confusing but with the help of the truth table, it made things much easier. Additionally, I also learnt the importance of resistors. In this case, they needed to be used as it would prevent any displays that may not be accurate to what was intended. In general, I liked this particular exercise as not only was it quite simple to understand despite my limited knowledge, it was also useful to know for any future projects.

                Similar to the previous assignment, I too liked this one. Although guided as well, I had no difficulty going through it as it was easy to understand. It used the basics that were taught earlier during the lesson so it was good to apply them right after learning them. While I found the coding to be very tedious, I understood its importance in making sure each part of it was correct so as to prevent any errors.
