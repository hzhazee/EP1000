                I got my first ever certification for FabLab! Upon completing the safety quiz, I have learnt a lot about what I should and shouldn't do while in the labs. One of the things that caught my attention was the fact that wearing long sleeves was discouraged. Initially, I thought it would be good to wear long sleeves since there would be a lower risk of getting injured, similar to the concept of wearing goggles. I then later realised that we were handling with machinery, hence it is possible for the sleeves to get caught in them.

                <p>
                Overall, together with other certifications, I cannot wait to start trying out the machinery available in the labs and be able to work on my project!

                My next certification was for 3D printing. It was interesting to find out how it all works and the pros and cons of using the various printing technologies. It turns out that 3D printing is more customizable than I thought. At first, I imagined it to be somewhat intuitive, where the machine and/or software would automatically input what the best settings should be. It was enlightening to find out that I could customize settings like the infill and resolution depending on my project.

                Before going through the Brightspace course, I had no idea LASER was actually an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. I guess I pretty much assumed "laser" was just another word in the dictionary. One of the main takeaways that I made sure to take note was the settings when cutting and engraving. Both were to have no fill and "hairline" as the line weight; the only difference was the colour of the strokes: red for cutting, green for engraving.
                </p>
                <p>
                Before I did my first test cut on the laser cutter in school, I was a little nervous. I had never done anything like it before so I was afraid I was going to do something wrong that could potentially ruin the machine. On the previous day, I read through a bunch of notes to make sure I got the steps right. Of course, that was just me being a major overthinker. On the day itself, I mentioned I was a first-time user and luckily, I managed to get some help and got to learn the ropes. In my assignments to come, I hope to make use of the laser cutter more often so that I could put what I have learnt in practice.
