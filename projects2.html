                To be completely honest, I found this exercise quite difficult at first. I did not have that much practice working with Fusion 360 prior to it. With the given example as a guide, I tried to break down the different shapes used before I began sketching. Doing this step-by-step definitely had made it much easier for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I started off with a rectangle, then 2 circles at the side with their centers aligned to the sides of the rectangle. This then became a "sausage"-like shape. To create the keyhole, I sketched 2 circles, one bigger than the other, placing them on one end of that shape. This eventually became the base of my name tag. To complete it, I extruded the necessary faces and used a new tool I learnt called "Shell" to create the rim around the edges. Lastly, I added my name and extruded it accordingly.

                For this particular exercise, I did not have much of an issue with it as thankfully, there was already a tutorial provided. I really liked it as the narrator, Kevin Kennedy, explained each step very clearly so I was able to easily understand their purposes. It was good to know about the "Rectangular Pattern" feature, especially if I ever need to make repetitive parts on a 3D model. Another thing that I like about Fusion 360 is how intuitive it is. I can just create one construction line from one end to another and it will know where the center is. There was no need to create multiple lines. I took note of the "Fillet" tool which can be also useful when I wanted to make certain edges not as sharp.

                This exercise also included a tutorial, hence this was a quick follow-through. Similarly, I did not face many issues with this but I did stumble on the step which required me to chamfer the edges of the hexagonal solid. After creating the lines of the chamfer shape, I kept noticing that it did not go through the center of the hexagon. After many tries, I realised that I had not been sketching on the correct plane at all. I then made sure to select the right plane and my problem was solved. 
                </p>
                <p>
                A new tool that I learnt was "Revolve" which helped to chamfer all 6 edges of the hexagon with the lines that were drawn earlier. I really liked the "Mirror" feature as it could reflect whatever that was done in previous steps to another part of a 3D model. There was no need to manually repeat the same steps over and over again. It was also interesting to see how the "Hole" tool was very customizable. There were so many different features a user could play around with like the "Hole Tap Type" and "Thread Offset". One thing I never noticed about Fusion 360 was the timeline that was located at the bottom. I simply had to scrub through it if I ever needed anything changed and it even showed what tool was used at a particular step. It was such a productive way to go back several steps without having to hit Ctrl+Z all the way to the part I want changed. A game changer indeed.

                [Hide canvas for better view of 3D model] Now with the extra practice with the above exercises, it was time to model a chess piece. We were told that we could model any chess piece we wanted so I chose to model a bishop. Using an image as a template, I placed it into Fusion 360 and began my sketch.
                </p>
                <p>
                The bottom parts of the bishop were relatively straightforward; I sketched out circles and extruded them accordingly. Next was the middle portion, in which I used a newly learnt tool, "Loft". It was good to use it to create the tapered shape as pictured in the template. I repeated this step a few times, changing the width, length and position of the profiles. After adding more circular solids, I had to model the "diamond" shape. I sketched out one-half of it first, extruded then used the "Mirror" tool to combine to get one solid diamond. Essentially, I could sketch the whole diamond first, but I wanted to use what I had learnt in the previous exercises. I finished it off by adding a few more extra bits at the top; I did not model the circular uppermost part of the piece in the reference as I found out that printing spherical shapes would be difficult and not look as nice. Next, I used the "Fillet" tool for smoother edges to match the template. After hollowing out the chess piece by using the "Shell" tool, I then exported it as an STL file so that it could be brought over into Ultimaker Cura.

                <p>
                In the software, I made the size of the chess piece to be smaller and changed the settings accordingly to the Ultimaker printers available in school. I really liked that the software was able to let me know how long the print would take; in my case, it was about an hour. I got some consultation if I could reduce the printing time and was told that increasing the line width to 0.65 mm (it was 0.4 mm by default) would do so. However, it did not make much of a difference as the time ended up being reduced by only around 10 to 15 minutes so I just kept the line width to its default. Although I did not put this tip to use this time around, it was good to note that if I had bigger projects, the printing time could possibly be reduced by half. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Once the chess piece was completely printed, I had to remove the supports located mostly around the middle portion (the blue parts as seen in the Cura screenshot). Contrary to what I thought, they were quite solid and not very loose that they could just be pried off. I used a pen knife to cut them out and finally, I could remove them all. Overall, I am satisfied with the end result as it turned out just as I modelled and does not have much defects.

                For this particular exercise, I wanted to model something that had a more organic shape, for example something that had more curvy shapes rather than stick-straight lines. I found a tutorial which showed how to make a custom name plate which seemed cool as it looked like as if it was bent. After creating the base and text sketch, I learnt about the "Sweep" command which would help to create a 3-dimensional shape from a 2D profile. Next, I had to create a path in which the "Sweep" command would follow. This was done using the 3-point arc tool. It was then just a matter of activating the "Sweep" command so it would follow the path of the arc that I just sketched out. The distance at which the path was drawn was also shortened so that if I were to actually print the model out, the overhang would not be too extreme to the point that supports were needed. Lastly, I added some final touches to the baseplate by chamfering the edges.
